# Bluetooth to Bluetooth SENDER Code (requires a BLE device running RECEIVER Code)

# NOTE: This code is a modified version of the original SENDER code.py
# It removes the first button, A1 on the CPB, from the list of touchpads
# and instead has a potentiometer hooked up to board.A1.
# Rotating the potentiometer will now change the color on the RECEIVER.
# Nothing in the original RECEIVER code needs to be changed.
# This SENDER code no longer has events for releasing the touchpads or
# Button_A since those previously sent a BLACK color & now all colors are
# sent by the potentiometer.
# There are a few more inputs here to handle colorwheel & AnalogIn
# And there is code to setup the potentiometer on board.A1, but you'll
# find the code to read the potentiometer value & send it as a ColorPacket
# just above the touchpad and button press codes in the while loop. 

# Also assumes RECEIVER has a folder named drumSounds containing .wav files as listed in RECEIVER
# Also note sender & receiver must also send / look for the same receiver_name,
# which you'll find in the line below named.
# Be sure to change to something unique & <11 chars in BOTH the sender & receiver code.py files.
# receiver_name = "profg-r"
